# Description
This project is a naive base 10 step-by-step maths calculator implemented in Java, it can do basic calculations and flexible to have new operators and types of operands added in it. 
The author designed the whole project himself in freshman year. Albeit, the author later learnt the theory of finite automata and compiler design, and this project worked as a bridging piece.
Due to some time limitation, the author wasn't able to further update it to realize the "functions" and "Rationals". 
The basic functionality of detecting arithmetic formulas and break it down step by step still works, however, sometimes the string-to-number algorithm doesn't work normally and lead to a mistake.
